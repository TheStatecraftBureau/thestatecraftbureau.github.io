            <h1>About the Developer</h1>
            <p>
                The Statecraft Bureau is an independent studio founded with the goal of creating deep strategic games where not only tactics,
                but also systemic thinking truly matter. The project is developed by a single developer and is not a full-time occupation, which means
                that development pace may vary, and some visual elements may not reach their ideal form in the first iterations. Nevertheless,
                with active community feedback, the project is planned to be supported and expanded for several years after release — through fixes,
                new content, and patches.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main and currently the only focus of the studio is the development of State Rise: From Ashes — a strategic RTS about the formation
                of statehood, infrastructure building, societal development, production chains, and the management of internal and external processes.
                The game is being created entirely from scratch: all systems, mechanics, and visual elements are crafted manually using the engine and
                development tools. Every mechanic goes through multiple stages — implementation, testing, optimization, revision, and reintegration.
                All of this is necessary to minimize errors in the final product. We follow the principle that everyone should have the opportunity
                to experience something meaningful, which is why significant time and effort are already dedicated to optimization and accessibility,
                ensuring that the game is comfortable for as wide an audience as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Development is conducted openly and accompanied by regular devlog posts, which detail the creation of all major systems:
                transport, urban planning, economy, technologies, ideology, and the behavior of states.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Statecraft Bureau strives to ensure that every part of the game — from administrative buildings to climate effects — is logical,
                realistic, and interconnected. Modern tools are used throughout development: Unity, URP, procedural environment systems, proprietary
                AI algorithms, a modular data structure, and a flexible architecture of gameplay subsystems. All of this is aimed at creating a strategy
                in which decisions have real consequences, and the world responds to the player naturally and consistently.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside the game, the project's infrastructure is being developed: the official website, documentation system, patch structure,
                localization tools, and support for future expansions. In the long term, the studio plans to grow, release new projects, and scale
                existing developments, provided the community response is positive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Statecraft Bureau is a studio where strategy games are created not for the sake of form, but for the sake of meaning.
                Here, every mechanic is part of a larger idea, every patch is a step forward, and every system is a piece of a living world shaped
                by the hands of the player.
            </p>
